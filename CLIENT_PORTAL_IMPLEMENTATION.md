# Client Portal Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation enhances the client experience by providing both **anonymous RFI response** (existing) and **authenticated client portal access** (new) through a single entry point.

## üéØ User Experience Flow

### Current Flow (Preserved)
1. Client receives email with secure token link
2. Clicks link ‚Üí sees RFI directly
3. Can respond anonymously without login ‚úÖ

### Enhanced Flow (New)
4. **On the RFI page**, client sees login banner: "Want to see all your RFIs and reports?"
5. Client can choose:
   - **Option A**: Dismiss banner and respond anonymously (current flow)
   - **Option B**: Click "Login to Portal" for full access

6. **If Login to Portal**:
   - Modal opens with login/signup options
   - After authentication ‚Üí redirects to full client portal
   - Gets access to: RFI Log, Reports, Project Status
