-- PERMANENT ACTIVITY LOG BACKFILL SCRIPT  
-- ========================================
-- This script ensures your RFI activity log is permanent by:
-- 1. Setting up automatic triggers for future changes
-- 2. Backfilling all existing RFIs with creation activities
-- 3. Making sure the activity log never disappears

-- 1. ENSURE TRIGGERS ARE ACTIVE for automatic logging
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_rfi_status_change()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Only log if status or stage actually changed
    IF OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status OR OLD.stage IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.stage THEN
        INSERT INTO rfi_status_logs (
            rfi_id,
            from_status,
            to_status,
            from_stage,
            to_stage,
            changed_by,
            changed_at,
            additional_data
        ) VALUES (
