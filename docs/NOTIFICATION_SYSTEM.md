  performed_by_name: 'John Smith',
  performed_by_email: 'john@abccorp.com',
  performed_by_type: 'client',
  action_details: 'Client response submitted with status: approved',
  metadata: { response_status: 'approved', client_name: 'ABC Corp' }
});

// Send enhanced client response notification
await NotificationService.notifyClientResponse(
  rfiId, 
  responseStatus, 
  clientName,
  responderName,
  clientEmail,
  teamEmails
);

// Send status change notification with user tracking
await NotificationService.notifyStatusChange(
  rfiId,
  fromStatus,
  toStatus,
  changedBy,
  reason
);

// Send link generation notification with user attribution
await NotificationService.notifyLinkGenerated(
  rfiId,
  generatedBy,
  linkExpiresAt

```typescript
// Enhanced workflow transition with user tracking
const result = await RFIWorkflowService.executeTransition(
  rfiId,
  targetStatus,
  currentStatus,
  userId, // Now tracked in notifications
  additionalData
);

// Automatically creates notification with user information
await NotificationService.notifyStatusChange(
  rfiId,
  currentStatus,
  targetStatus,
  userId,
  reason
);
```

## Enhanced Email Templates

### Client Response Email Template
Now includes a dedicated "Who Responded" section:

```html
